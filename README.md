Vigenere Cipher
===
Domain Driven Design implementation of the famous Vigen√®re cipher
---
The purpose of this example is the usage of a rich domain model `VigenereCipher`, 
containing the entire logic and state via value objects made out primitive data types. 
The object is instantiated via a function and never changed after that.

Included:
- Objects instead of primitive types
- Function(s) instead of a single constructor
- Unit tests for PhpUnit

The idea of DDD is opposed to anemic models where most of the logic is pushed away into services.
